## GA_WDI_13_ATX: Final Project.
Kitstagram is a community for cat lovers, who want to share stories/photos of the cats they come across in their every day, or virtual lives. Everyone knows that cats are the best thing on social media...so why not turn it into social MEOW-dia? (that hurt me more to say, than it hurt you to read)
This is a continuation of my project 2 app.

##  Technologies used
This is a full CRUD app using:
-  node.js - A server side javascript tool that allows JS to be run in our terminal.
-  npm - Node package manager which help to control and download our modules.
-  express - A back-end framework
-  MongoDB - Used to create and store data
-  Mongoose - The bridge between Mongo  and your app, which makes things cleaner/drier.
-  jQuery - A javascript library that allows for cleaner, less verbose code.
-  ejs - Embedded Javascript allows JS to be run in the html code.
-  OAuth - Allows user to log in from a third party source.
